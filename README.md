# Welcome to My Personal Website

Hello everyone! Welcome to my corner on the internet. I'm thrilled to have you here and excited to share a bit about myself and the work I do.

## About Me

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer specializing in creating dynamic and user-friendly web experiences. I have a knack for translating complex ideas into sleek, navigable websites that not only look good but function seamlessly.

## Technologies I Love

My tech stack is primarily centered around:

- **React.js:** For building user interfaces with interactive components.
- **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, ensuring code reliability and reducing runtime errors.
- **Redux:** For state management across the React apps, making the data flow more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Module SCSS:** Allowing me to style components with scoped CSS to avoid style conflicts and promote reusability.
